# Building a Multipurpose Resume Hosted on GitHub Pages
Do you struggle with figuring out how best to summarize your diverse (and, perhaps, lengthy...) experience into a handful or two of machine-learning-friendly bullet points?
Are you applying to several different types of jobs, perhaps seeking to make a career change?
Are you an inveterate tinkerer who likes to play around with technology?
If so, consider using Jekyll Collections to make a "Smart" Multipurpose Resume.

Jekyll is a popular free command-line program for Windows, Linux, or Mac that generates static web pages from your plain text or markdown documents. Crucially, it is used by [GitHub's Pages platform](https://pages.github.com), which provides an option for free web hosting; or you can upload the pages to your own server.
